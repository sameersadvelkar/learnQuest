        "question": "Which keyword is recommended for declaring variables in modern JavaScript?",
        "options": ["var", "let", "const", "Both let and const"],
        "correct": 3,
        "explanation": "Both 'let' and 'const' are recommended in modern JavaScript. Use 'const' for values that won't change, and 'let' for values that will change."

        "options": ["true", "false", "undefined", "error"],
        "correct": 1,
        "explanation": "The strict equality operator (===) checks both value and type. Since 5 is a number and '5' is a string, the result is false."

        "question": "JavaScript is a dynamically typed language.",
        "correct": true,
        "explanation": "True. JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning variables can hold different types of values and their types can change during runtime."

        "options": ["The quotient", "The remainder", "The sum", "The difference"],
        "correct": 1,
