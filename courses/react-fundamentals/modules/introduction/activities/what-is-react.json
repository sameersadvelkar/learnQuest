    "text": "React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly web applications. Created by Facebook in 2011, React has revolutionized how developers think about building interactive UIs.\n\n## Key Benefits of React:\n\n### 1. Component-Based Architecture\nReact applications are built using components - reusable pieces of UI that encapsulate their own state and logic. This makes code more modular and easier to maintain.\n\n### 2. Virtual DOM\nReact uses a virtual representation of the DOM that enables efficient updates. When state changes, React calculates the minimal changes needed and updates only those parts of the real DOM.\n\n### 3. Declarative Programming\nWith React, you describe what the UI should look like for any given state, and React handles the how. This makes your code more predictable and easier to debug.\n\n### 4. Strong Ecosystem\nReact has a vast ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community support that makes development faster and more efficient.\n\n## React vs Other Frameworks\n\nUnlike frameworks like Angular or Vue, React is focused specifically on the view layer of applications. This gives you more flexibility in choosing other tools for routing, state management, and data fetching."
